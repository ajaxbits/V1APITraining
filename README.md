# V1APITraining

This repository contain some example code we use during a Trend Micro Vision One API training.

Documentation for the API's are here : https://automation.trendmicro.com/xdr/Guides/Getting-Started

Duration 4 hours.

This training is based on Vision One version 2.0 API and will be updated in the future to support version 3.0 

This is unsupported material outside the training session. It is given as is.

I tested mostly with Python 3.7 and 3.9 under Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04. It was not tested on Mac since I don't have one anymore. If it works for you please let me know. If it does not work then fix it yourself, this will be a good learning opportunity and let us know.

I use PyCharm (Community version works fine) during this workshop. The code should run in other IDE but during the course you MUST use PyCharm or remain silence during the workshop, no time to debug every specific IDE. Don't waste other people time.
